I've been meaning to start this weekly update blog for quite some time now, but for one reason or another, it's just never materialised. So without further ado, here is my first week!
<!-- more -->
It's actually been a bit worse than usual this week. I started of the week intending to finish a whole load of stuff at work, get on top of things at home and really improve myself by starting to make my way through the problems at [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net). Unfortunately, my daughter was ill Thursday and Friday, my wife picked up the bug on Saturday and Sunday and I was then out of action Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. So as for a first week, this is going to be a bit empty, but I guess I have to start somewhere.

First of all, let's talk about Project Euler. I was actually recommended this site by a friend who is currently doing some recruitment as a good practice for any recruitment examples that come up. I'm not actually looking for a new job, but ever since being made redundant last year and the ever looming Brexit deadline has made me realise that I may need to be ready at any point. And with a young child, getting any free time for interview prep would be incredibly hard and so a little each day would be much better.

For those unaware what Project Euler is, it's a site where people have contributed problems that are to be solved using simple code. Obviously, the further you progress, the more difficult they are, but none the less, when you get into the hang of it, they become quite fun and interesting to solve. For me, they are look doing exam questions when I was back at school. Yes, I know the answer and yes, when I was back then doing these exams regularly, they were simple, but when I go back to those same questions now, I have to figure out what on earth they are actually asking! But none the less, it is a great tool which I am really loving at the moment. Of course, once you have completed the task and got the right answer, you gain access to a thread where people have posted their answers (which in some circumstances seem far too complicated for the problem at hand, but maybe that's just me).

Secondly, this week I have started to re-think our coding exercise problem at work for our interview process. As I don't want to give it away, I won't post it here, but it is a fairly trivial task regarding iteration over an array in either Java or Scala. It's a problem we have been using as part of our interviews for a very long time and there are concerns that we are now seeing this problem being solved by too many people. Admittedly, it really isn't that difficult, but we do need to ensure that we aren't passing people simply because they know the interview question. The problem for me, is that I like coding exercises to be relevant. As an example, when I was working at Sky, we decided to re-haul our interview exercise to be specific about one of our products, but abstracted. This meant that we could test their relevant thought process and development skills. However, in my current team in Morgan Stanley, I'm struggling to see how to create a relevant problem, that isn't simply "implement this interface" which does nothing but talk to mocks.
